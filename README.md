# GhostBusters

## Introduction
This project implements an AI agent capable of detecting and capturing ghosts in a haunted environment using probabilistic inference techniques.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ghostbusters.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ghostbusters/`

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- matplotlib

## Installation
Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the GhostBusters agent:

bash
Copy code
python ghostbusters.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the agent and observe its ghost-catching capabilities.

Project Structure
The project includes the following files and directories:

ghostbusters.py: Main script to run the GhostBusters agent.
inference.py: Contains functions for probabilistic inference and Bayesian network operations.
factorOperations.py: Includes functions for joining factors and variable elimination.
bustersAgents.py: Defines different types of GhostBusters agents and their behavior.
util.py: Utility functions used throughout the project.
